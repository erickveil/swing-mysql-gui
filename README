To Build:

Using IdeaJ 13.x

Download jdbc connector at 

http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j

Clone this project, open in IdeaJ.

In the Project tree, right click your jdk library under External Libraries.

Open Library Settings from the dropdown.

Press the + icon.

Add a path to the jar file you downloaded for the jdbc.

Click OK.

Check to see if your MySQL server is running:

sudo service mysqld status

Run it if not:

sudo service mysqld start

Open a terminal and cd to this project, in the data directory.

mysql -u root -p -e "create database javatest"
mysql -u -p javatest < javatestdump.sql

Now go back to IdeaJ and make MainWindow and run.
